      <p>
        Hi, I’m Arfah Aadil, an MSc Software Engineering graduate with a passion for building scalable, secure, 
        and efficient software solutions. My technical skills spans in full-stack development, from building robust 
        backend systems with Java, as well as creating responsive and user-friendly frontend interfaces using 
        HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React. I also have experience designing and deploying cloud-native applications 
        on platforms like GCP. I have hands-on experience with microservices architecture, REST APIs, Docker, 
        Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines, enabling me to develop high-performance systems that meet business and
        user needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I enjoy collaborating in Agile teams, solving complex problems, and continuously learning new technologies 
       to enhance my skill set. Throughout my projects and internships, I’ve contributed to enterprise internal 
       platforms, data-driven systems, and automation tools, always striving to deliver impactful solutions. 
       I’m eager to take on challenging software engineering roles where I can apply my technical skills 
       and creativity to drive meaningful results.
