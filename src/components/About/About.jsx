      <p>
        Hi, I’m Arfah Aadil, an MSc Software Engineering graduate with experience in Java, Spring Boot, React, 
        and cloud application development. I specialize in building scalable backend systems, secure REST APIs, 
        and responsive frontends, with hands-on experience in Docker, Kubernetes, cloud platforms, and CI/CD 
        pipelines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a passion for creating efficient, user-focused software solutions and thrive in Agile environments. 
       Through my internships, freelance work, and academic projects, I’ve contributed to enterprise platforms, 
       automation tools, and data-driven systems, always aiming to deliver impactful and high-performance 
       applications.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m currently seeking Software Engineering opportunities with a focus on full-stack development and cloud 
       applications, where I can apply my skills, grow professionally, and contribute to meaningful projects.
